# EcoLens

EcoLens is a hackathon-built web interface that makes environmental impact visible, understandable, and actionable. It helps people and teams see the footprint of everyday choices, build better habits, and celebrate progress together.

## Premise

- Visibility gap: Environmental costs are real but often hidden or hard to compare.
- Action gap: Even when people care, they lack timely, personalized guidance.
- Engagement gap: Sustained behavior change needs feedback, community, and rewards.

EcoLens addresses these gaps by translating complex sustainability data into clear signals, lightweight guidance, and positive feedback loops.

## Potential Impacts

- Individual behavior change: Clear scoring and tips nudge better everyday decisions.
- Team and community momentum: Leaderboards, streaks, and shared goals amplify impact.
- Organizational insights: Aggregated, privacy‑aware metrics inform choices and reporting.
- Data literacy: Transparent assumptions and methods build trust and understanding.
- Policy and research readiness: Comparable metrics enable constructive, evidence‑based dialogue.

## Future Steps

- Data expansion: Broaden datasets and methodologies (e.g., LCA sources, supply‑chain signals).
- Method transparency: Publish scoring assumptions, uncertainty, and versioned methodologies.
- Privacy and trust: Strengthen consent flows, local processing, and data minimization.
- Product depth: Mobile/PWA, offline support, receipt/barcode parsing, and a browser extension.
- Integrations: Open API, partner tooling, and import/export pipelines.
- Accessibility and equity: WCAG compliance, localization, and inclusive defaults.

## Running the App

Run `npm i` to install dependencies, then `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Summary

EcoLens turns hidden environmental impacts into clear, motivating insights that drive better choices at individual and group levels. By combining transparent methods, engaging feedback, and thoughtful integrations, it lays groundwork for measurable, privacy‑respecting change. Next, we’ll deepen data coverage, refine scoring transparency, expand platforms, and open integrations to grow impact.
